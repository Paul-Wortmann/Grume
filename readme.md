## Contributions:

Please note, I am not looking for contributions.
While I do appreciate the offer, this is a personal project I use for testing ideas and improving my code.
However feel free to open issues.

## Known bugs:

As this is still a work in progress the format of the savegames may, and quite often changes.
It is recommended you either overwrite your older savegames with new ones, or delete the older ones when upgrading to a newer version of Frost and Flame.
Or better still remove the older version of the game completely, before installing a newer version.
If the game fails to load, try deleting all config files, the game will recreate them with default settings.
